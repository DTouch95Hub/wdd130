            <h2> General Knowledge</h2>
            <p> Holy Grail, object sought by the knights of Arthurian legend as part of a quest that, particularly from the 13th century, 
                had Christian meaning. The term grail evidently denoted a wide-mouthed or shallow vessel, 
                though its precise etymology remains uncertain.</p>

            <h2> Subject of discussion</h2>
            <p>In general, people refer to a goal that seems almost impossible to reach as a Holy Grail. 
                More technically, the term Holy Grail refers specifically to the cup that Jesus used at the Last Supper. 
                But exactly what is the quest for the Holy Grail?

                As a specialist in medieval Christian history, I know that several important threads 
                have combined over the centuries to give rise to the Holy Grail metaphor commonly used nowadays. 
                These include elements of pre-Christian mythology, the veneration of relics in Christian tradition, 
                and medieval literature from Britain and France.</p>
