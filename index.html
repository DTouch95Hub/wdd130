    <p> Hello! My name is Georges Jr. Latouche, and I'm from Port-au-Prince, Haiti. I enjoy reading, gaming, studying, and self-development.
        Technology is my passion, and I'm fortunate to be working at a telecom company.</p>

        <p>Located on the Cul-de-Sac plain, in an amphitheatrical setting at the foot of the Selle mountain,
            Port-au-Prince, capital of the Republic of Haiti, was founded in 1749 by the French. 
            Protected from northeasterly winds at the head of a bay in the Gulf of GonÃ¢ve, 
            the city has the dual advantage of being well sheltered and easy to defend, 
            and is the heart of Haiti's economic and commercial activity. Capital of the colony of Saint-Domingue in 1770, 
            in place of Cap-FranÃ§ais, then of the new Haitian nation in 1804, Port-au-Prince is also the center of the country's political and intellectual life.</p>
